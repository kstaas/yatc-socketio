TODO

Don't let the client toggle on/off the roll state of any die for first roll.
On the first roll, all the die must be rolled.

Only enable the roll button when one or more die have been marked for rolling.

On startup, draw all five dice using the reverse blank image.
Then, as the the roll flag is toggled swap the reverse/non-reverse images.
And, when toggling images, don't redraw the whole dice tag, just the img tag for the dice in question.
